# order-routing-system

To structure the user experience of your print routing system, consider the following epics and user stories:

### Epics
1. **Order Management**
   - Handling the entire lifecycle of print orders from creation to delivery.

2. **Printer Management**
   - Managing printer partners, their capabilities, availability, and performance.

3. **Assignment Logic**
   - Smart assignment of print orders to the most suitable printers based on various criteria.

4. **Pricing and Cost Management**
   - Managing pricing models and cost estimation for orders.

5. **Shipping and Logistics**
   - Handling shipping methods, delivery tracking, and logistics.

6. **Dashboard and Reporting**
   - Providing a real-time overview of the system, monitoring orders, printers, and performance metrics.

### User Stories

#### Order Management Epic
1. **As a customer**, I want to create a print order, so that I can have my documents printed.
2. **As a customer**, I want to track the status of my print order, so that I know when to expect delivery.

#### Printer Management Epic
1. **As an admin**, I want to add new printer partners, so that I can expand the printing options.
2. **As an admin**, I want to view printer performance, so that I can ensure quality service.

#### Assignment Logic Epic
1. **As an admin**, I want the system to automatically assign print orders to printers, so that orders are processed efficiently.

#### Pricing and Cost Management Epic
1. **As a customer**, I want to receive an estimated cost for my print order, so that I know how much I will be charged.

#### Shipping and Logistics Epic
1. **As a customer**, I want to select a shipping method for my order, so that I can choose the most convenient delivery option.

#### Dashboard and Reporting Epic
1. **As an admin**, I want to view all ongoing orders in a dashboard, so that I can monitor the system's activity.
2. **As an admin**, I want to access performance reports, so that I can make informed decisions about the system.

### User Experience Flow
- **Placing an Order**: A user logs in, creates an order with specifications, and receives a cost estimate. They select a shipping method and complete the order.
- **Order Assignment and Processing**: The system automatically assigns the order to a suitable printer. The printer processes the order.
- **Tracking and Updates**: The user tracks the order status through the dashboard. Updates on order progress are available.
- **Delivery and Feedback**: Once printed, the order is shipped. After delivery, the user can provide feedback.

This structure provides a comprehensive view of the system's functionalities, focusing on the essential aspects of the service from both the customer's and the admin's perspectives.
